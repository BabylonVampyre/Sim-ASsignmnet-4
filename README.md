## How to Use
The requirements are listed in the requirements.
To run the code, simply run the model_run.py file. This will run five different scenario's and output the five csv files in the experiment folder
If you want to generate the N1N2.csv file (which has already been provided) yourself, run the format_data.py file. This takes the _roads3.csv and the BMMS_overview.xlsx files in the data folder as input
If you want to generate the plots(which have been provided in the report), run the experiment_viz.py.
If you want to show the model visualiser, rn model_viz

## Notes
Python version 3.11 was used.

The requirements.txt file was generated by pycharm but did not include openpyxl, but since it was used we have added it manually. There is a chance that there are more missing requirements, or that openpyxl is not needed.
